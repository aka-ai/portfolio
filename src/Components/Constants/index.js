  brieflyAboutMe: `I'm a developer, I'm passionate about designing and building things`,

  aboutMe: `At some points in my life I studied fashion design, I worked at some Michelin-Starred restaurants, and I created my own culinary brand, Aicooks.\n\nI was raised in rural Thailand with modest ambition, but once I moved to New York I learned to think bigger with a growth mindset. There I discovered my passions for the fashion and culinary worlds. During my time working in those fields, I found myself repeatedly looking for opportunities to utilize software to improve our processes, products, and services.\n\nI wanted to learn more about how to leverage software to communicate and enable customers, so I spent hundreds of hours learning JavaScript and was accepted into a coding bootcamp where I dove deeper, learned at a rapid pace, and built a variety of applications.\n\nAs a developer, I practice continuous learning by pursuing ideas that interest me and building applications to bring them to life. This helps me exercise my curiosity, work ethic, and design sensibility in anticipation of my next role as a frontend developer.`,
